# AGS10_sensor

This library allows you to read the TVOC (total volatile organic compounds) data in ppb as well as read and set current sensor resistance in 0.1 kÎ©.

See the exmaples folder for how to use the library. (more/better ones coming soon)

Confirmed working with Arduino will check ESP32 soon.
